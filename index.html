            <p>Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine
                that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.
                Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine
                capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.
                The machine operates on an infinite memory tape divided into discrete "cells".
                The machine positions its "head" over a cell and "reads" or "scans" the symbol there.
                Then, based on the symbol and the machine's own present state in a "finite table"
                of user-specified instructions, the machine first writes a symbol
                (e.g., a digit or a letter from a finite alphabet) in the cell
                (some models allow symbol erasure or no writing), then either moves the
                tape one cell left or right (some models allow no motion, some models move the head),
                then, based on the observed symbol and the machine's own state in the table,
                either proceeds to another instruction or halts the computation.</p>

        <h2>A Turing machine consists of:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A tape divided into cells, one next to the other. Each cell contains a symbol
                from some finite alphabet. The alphabet contains a special blank symbol
                (here written as '0') and one or more other symbols. The tape is assumed
                to be arbitrarily extendable to the left and to the right, so that the Turing
                machine is always supplied with as much tape as it needs for its computation.
            </li>
            <li>
                A head that can read and write symbols on the tape and move the
                tape left and right one (and only one) cell at a time. In some models
                the head moves and the tape is stationary.
            </li>
            <li>
                A state register that stores the state of the Turing machine,
                one of finitely many. Among these is the special start state
                with which the state register is initialized. These states,
                writes Turing, replace the "state of mind" a person performing
                computations would ordinarily be in.
            </li>
            <li>
                A finite table of instructions that, given the state(q<sub>i</sub>)
                the machine is currently in and the symbol(a<sub>j</sub>) it is
                reading on the tape (symbol currently under the head), tells the machine to do the following in sequence (for the 5-tuple models):
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Either erase or write a symbol (replacing a<sub>j</sub> with a<sub>j1</sub>).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Move the head (which is described by d<sub>k</sub> and can have values:
                        'L' for one step left or 'R' for one step right or 'N'
                        for staying in the same place).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Assume the same or a new state as prescribed (go to state q<sub>i1</sub>).
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
